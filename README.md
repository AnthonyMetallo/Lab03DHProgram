# Lab03DHProgram

This project simulates a Diffie-Hellman key exchange and demonstrates a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack using a stateful PRNG stream cipher.

## Features
- Implementation of `SecurePRNG` with Rollback Resistance.
- Stream cipher using XOR operation.
- MITM simulation with message tampering.
